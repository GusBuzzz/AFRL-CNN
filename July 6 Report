Below are the CSV file names, which represent the output results of the "model2.1_1920_1080.h5" file. 
Each file name provides valuable information about the data received and the observations made by the model.

During the testing phase, the model processed an input folder containing a mix of real and synthetic images. 
Its task was to separate these images into two distinct folders. Real images were placed in the "real" folder, 
while synthetic images were assigned to the "synthetic" folder. This classification process was repeated for 
each image in the input folder until all images were classified.

Upon completion of the execution, the model not only sorted the input images into their respective predicted folders
but also generated a CSV file. This file contains the image names along with the labels assigned by the model.
